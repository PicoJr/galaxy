Code is heavily inspired from this [Piston-Tutorial](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/Piston-Tutorials/tree/master/sudoku)

Collision was implemented using this [tutorial](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-custom-2d-physics-engine-the-basics-and-impulse-resolution--gamedev-6331)
